## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### No Sound Playing?
- Check browser sound permissions
- Ensure volume is not muted
- Try clicking on the page first (some browsers require user interaction)
- Sound only plays once when goal is reached

### Updates Not Live?
- Make sure you've clicked "Parse Logs"
- Check that data is present
- Auto-refresh works only when summaries exist

### Grid View Not Showing 2 Columns?
- Grid view requires medium+ screen size (768px+)
- On mobile, grid view shows single column (compact mode)
- Try expanding your browser window

### Time Format Still 24-Hour?
- Only "Leave by" time uses AM/PM format
- Timeline events still use 24-hour for consistency
- This is intentional for professional logging

Currently, the app uses mouse/touch interaction. Future versions may include:
- `G` - Toggle Grid/List view
